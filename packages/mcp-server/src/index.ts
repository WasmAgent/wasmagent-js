/**
 * @wasmagent/mcp-server — F1.
 *
 * Take any object that runs like an agent (a `SubagentRunnable`) and expose
 * it as a Model Context Protocol server. The host (Claude Code, Cursor,
 * Copilot, etc.) gets a uniform, transport-agnostic interface — JSON-RPC
 * over a request/response handler — and gains the ability to call WasmAgent
 * agents like any other MCP server.
 *
 * ## Why this matters strategically
 *
 * The MCP ecosystem went from "fun project" to industry-default through
 * 2025–2026: it's been adopted by Anthropic, OpenAI, Microsoft, Google,
 * and AWS, and is now governed by the Linux Foundation's AAIF. Every
 * competing agent framework already publishes its agents AS MCP servers.
 * WasmAgent previously only consumed MCP — this package closes the loop.
 *
 * ## Spec target & design constraints
 *
 *   - **2025-11-25 stable** — the version production hosts (Claude Code,
 *     Cursor 2.4+) speak today. We implement: `initialize`, `tools/list`,
 *     `tools/call`, plus the 2025-11 `tasks/*` family for long-running work.
 *   - **2026-07-28 Release Candidate constraints** — designed to be safe to
 *     run when the RC ships:
 *       1. **Stateless core**: every request is self-contained. We do NOT
 *          rely on `Mcp-Session-Id` headers or in-memory session state.
 *          Long-task state lives in a {@link Checkpointer}-backed store and
 *          is keyed by the task id, which the host echoes back on poll.
 *       2. **Elicitation only during request handling**: server-initiated
 *          requests (await_human_input → MCP elicitation) are exposed as
 *          part of the active request's response, not pushed unsolicited.
 *
 * ## What ships in this file
 *
 *   - {@link McpAgentServer} — the orchestrator. Wraps any
 *     `SubagentRunnable` and answers MCP JSON-RPC requests.
 *   - {@link createFetchHandler} — a `(Request) => Promise<Response>` adapter
 *     that runs over Streamable HTTP (Workers-compatible). Hosts that prefer
 *     stdio can call `server.handle()` directly.
 *   - {@link McpTaskStore} — minimal KV-backed task store; defaults to
 *     in-memory. The CF Workers / Node host injects its real KV.
 *
 * Transport packaging (stdio framing, HTTP routing details) is left to the
 * host: this package provides the protocol-level brain, not a CLI binary.
